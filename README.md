# JourneyLens
I created this full-stack app, for people to showcase their travels around the world. Users can simply log in and go onto their profile to create a new post to show their friends what they've been up to and how their vacation is going.

## About
JourneyLens is a social media website that aims to connect people from around the world. It allows friends and families to share their adventures and travels with everyone. We're excited to build a community based on travel and adventuring beyond the norms.
